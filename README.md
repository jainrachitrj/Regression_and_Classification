<h1>Regression_and_Classification</h1>
<h3>This repository contains an implementation of Linear and Logistic Regression</h3>
<p>Linear Regression</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a linear regression model in Python to predict potential profits for a new restaurant franchise based on city population data to help identify profitable locations for new outlets.</li>
  <li>Implemented the <b>mean squared error</b> cost function and <b>gradient descent</b> algorithm for model training and optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Binary Classification using Logistic Regression</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trained a logistic regression model to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant pass quality assurance based on results from two different tests.</li>
  <li>Used <b>feature mapping</b> to capture complex patterns in the training data and to incorporate non-linear decision boundaries and <b>regularization</b> to combat the overfitting problem.</li>
</ul>
